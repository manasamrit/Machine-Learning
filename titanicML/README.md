# Titanic — Machine Learning from Disaster

End-to-end machine learning project for the classic Kaggle Titanic competition.  
This repository covers data exploration, feature engineering, model training/tuning, evaluation, a modern UI for exploration and prediction, and Kaggle-ready submissions.

## Project Structure

- `raw/`: Original data from Kaggle (`train.csv`, `test.csv`, `gender_submission.csv`).
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for EDA and experimentation.
- `src/`: Reusable Python modules and Streamlit app.
- `ui/`: Placeholder for additional front-end components if desired.

## Getting Started

1. Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Run the Streamlit app:

```bash
streamlit run src/app.py
```

More detailed documentation will be filled in as the project is built out.
